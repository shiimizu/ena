Low resource and high performance archiver to save posts, images and all relevant data from an imageboard into a local database and local image store. The project currently only supports 4chan.  

**This development branch is currently undergoing active breaking changes towards ena v0.8.0. Do not use in production. See the current [status](#Status).**

## Tracking changes
<!-- * ðŸš§ Fix getting all 4 variants of thumbnails ðŸš§ -->
* Better last modified detection
* Ability to use `-tail` json
* Fix the correct number of `replies` and `images`
* Add ability to use proxies
* Faster CTRL+C
* Actual Asagi support (support for legacy mysql)
* More options, flags, and customization
* Improved logging. Outputs to both `stdout` and `stderr`.
* Switch to YAML
* Lives up to the description by being able to get threads and/or boards in a oneshot fashion
* Reduce postgres min version. Probably >= `9` now.
* Now gets the correct number of thumbnails (op & reply) *
* **Database schema changes. Now one big `posts` table instead of seperated by board.**
* No longer reports the current position/total while logging since things are fetched concurrently
* Media fetching is no longer done in a background thread
* Now relying on md5 check before downloading media, which means no sha256sum collision detection
* Introduction of `unsafe` to clean post comments for Asagi.  

<small>* in progress</small>

## Features
* Ability to get `archive` threads
* Save bandwidth. Uses `If-Modified-Since` and `Last-Modified`. 
* Save even more bandwidth with the option of using `-tail.json`.
* State save restore. Resume right where you left off. No-frills updating to new releases.
* Poll boards/threads or oneshot
* Dynamic (consecutively increasing) thread refresh rate
* Retain `unique_ips` after archived
* Proxies
* TimescaleDB support
* Asagi drop-in replacement support
* `UPSERT` for superior thread accuracy and correctness
* `SHA256` for full media and thumbnails to prevent duplicates

## Quickstart
1. The easiest way to start is to give a config file:  
        `ena -c config.yml`
1. A database is created if it wasn't already.
1. ???
1. Profit

### Asagi drop-in
1. Set `asagi_mode` to `true` in the config or pass `--asagi` in the command line.
2. ???
2. Profit

## Building/Updating
1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already
1. Clone this branch and `cd` if you haven't already
   ```shell
   $ git clone --single-branch --branch dev https://github.com/shiimizu/ena.git ena-dev
   $ cd ena-dev
   ```

2. Building/Updating  
    ```shell
    $ cargo build --release -j4
    ```  
    Build artifacts can be found in `target/release/`  

## Status  
Core functionality works. There are things that could be improved on:  
* Things are a bit fragile at the moment as the codebase is littered with `unwrap()` (for debugging) and can panic if any one of them sets off. (This will be cleaned up as things are finalized)
* Postgres side
  * Currently not getting the correct amount of media files.  
        Solution found and implementation is underway. See [this report](error-media-log.md) for more information.

## Asagi drop-in status
Stable.

## Please respect the 4chan API guidelines as best you can
1. Use `Last-Modified` and `If-Modified-Since`
1. Ratelimit of atleast 1 second  

Respecting the first rule will get you very far.

## Architecture flow
1. Boards are fetched sequentially since doing so concurrently requires quite a bit of memory.

1. The list of threads are fetched from `threads.json` or `archive.json` and stored in the database.
   * The `Last-Modified` from the HTTP header is then stored in the database as a timestamp. Before fetching the threads list, this is checked so to not download the list again if it's not modified.

1. On startup of the program, threads are combined between in-db (if any) and received so as to get the **union** of both.  
   After the initial startup, all subsequent list of threads are the result of a **symmetric-difference** between in-db and received threads,  
   e.g only the modified threads such as deleted/updated/added/modified, resulting in a lower amount of threads to be processed.

2. Then each thread is fetched concurrently (based on `limit` setting).
    1. In each thread, every media file & thumbnail is fetched concurrently (based on `limit_media` setting) and its entry is upserted to the database.
    2. The thread is upserted to the database after media is done (if any), and then the `Last-Modified` from the HTTP header is stored in the `last_modified` column of the thread.
        * Before fetching a thread this is checked so to not download the thread again if it's not modified.

3. Once a board is finished (all its threads are fetched), the next one is fetched and the whole process starts all over again.


## Asagi specific implementation changes
* Added `with_utc_timestamps` as an option which adds `utc_timestamp`, `utc_timestamp_expired`, columns to boards and `utc_archived_on` to `{board}_threads` table
* Added `with_extra_columns` as an option which adds any extra or future columns to `exif`
* Added `boards` table to cache `threads.json`|`archive.json` for state save restore.
* Fixed updating `sticky` and `locked` for threads in triggers
* More accurate `deleted` posts due to upserts
* Cleaner sticky comments
* Use `{board}_threads`'s `time_last` to store `Last-Modified` from HTTP header. Nobody uses the `time_last` column so it's OK. 
* Any new changes for posts made by this implementation will overwrite the entry in your database due to upserts. 




## FAQ
##### Why not use `catalog.json`?
I've found it to be inaccurate.
